# zoochestrator
Imperva ZooChestrator is a library for managing task distribution between several computer nodes.        The library is built on top of Apache ZooKeeper and Apache Curator, and uses some of their recipes in order to manage the process, such as Leadership Election, Locks, Latches, and nodes. This library implements and extends the ZooKeeper “master-worker” pattern, which is widely described in Oreilly’s book "ZooKeeper -  Distributed Process Coordination”, by Flavio Junqueira and Benjamin Reed.        The book sample code can be found at this GitHub repository.
